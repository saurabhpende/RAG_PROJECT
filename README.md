# Financial Expert RAG_PROJECT
Iâ€™m excited to share my latest projectâ€”a Financial AI Chatbot that provides accurate banking and investment insights using LLMs + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)! ðŸš€

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
âœ… Dynamic Retrieval: Uses FAISS vector search to find the most relevant banking/investment FAQs.
âœ… Semantic Chunking & Reranking: Improves retrieval accuracy with clustering & Cross-Encoder ranking.
âœ… Interactive Chat UI: Built with Streamlit, featuring chat memory and past session retrieval (like ChatGPT!).
âœ… LLM Shield: Implements query validation to prevent hallucinations and irrelevant responses.
âœ… End-to-End RAG Pipeline: Seamlessly integrates embedding generation, FAISS retrieval, reranking, and LLM response synthesis.

ðŸ’¡ Tech Stack:
ðŸŸ¢ LangChain for prompt engineering & memory
ðŸŸ¢ OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for AI responses
ðŸŸ¢ FAISS for fast vector-based retrieval
ðŸŸ¢ Sentence-Transformers for reranking
ðŸŸ¢ Streamlit for an interactive UI

ðŸŽ¯ Why This Matters?
In the financial sector, accuracy is non-negotiable. Traditional chatbots often fail to retrieve precise information, but this AI system uses RAG + reranking to boost answer quality & trustworthiness!
